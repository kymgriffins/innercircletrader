> **Crafting solutions for the gr8 of algorithmic traders.**  
> A systematic documentation framework for translating ICT (Inner Circle Trader) concepts into algorithmic trading logic.

## 🎯 **Project Vision**

This repository serves as the **definitive documentation hub** for systematically translating ICT trading methodologies into algorithmic trading concepts. Before writing a single line of code, we're building a comprehensive knowledge base that defines unambiguous rules, detection logic, and integration frameworks.

**Core Philosophy:** *"If you can't define it precisely, you can't code it reliably."*

## 🏗️ **Current Phase: Documentation & Definition**

### **We're currently focusing on:**
✅ **Unambiguous Definitions** - Removing subjective interpretations  
✅ **Programmatic Rules** - Creating detection logic that can be coded  
✅ **Integration Frameworks** - How concepts work together  
✅ **Edge Case Documentation** - Handling market anomalies  

### **What this means:**
- No code yet - only precise specifications
- Every concept gets its own detection rulebook
- Priority on clarity over complexity
- Focus on reproducibility and backtestability

## 🔍 **Core Concepts Being Documented**

| Concept | Status | Focus Areas |
|---------|--------|-------------|
| **Market Structure** | 🔄 In Progress | BOS, CHoCH, Inducement detection |
| **Order Blocks** | 📋 Planned | Bullish/Bearish OB rules, consolidation logic |
| **Fair Value Gaps** | 📋 Planned | FVG types, fill vs. fade decisions |
| **Liquidity Pools** | 📋 Planned | Sweep detection, liquidity grabs |
| **Multi-Timeframe** | 📋 Planned | Bias alignment, confirmation rules |

---

## 🎯 **End Goal**

To produce **algorithm-ready specifications** that enable:
1. **Precise pattern detection** (no ambiguity)
2. **Systematic signal generation** (clear decision trees)
3. **Robust risk management** (rules-based stops)
4. **Repeatable backtesting** (consistent logic)

---

## 🤝 **Contribution Guidelines**

### **For Documenters & Researchers:**
1. Focus on **objective rules** over subjective interpretations
2. Include **visual examples** where helpful
3. Document **edge cases** and how to handle them
4. Create **decision trees** for ambiguous situations

### **Documentation Standards:**
- Each concept must have: Theory, Detection Rules, Examples, Edge Cases
- Use pseudocode for complex logic
- Include confidence scoring methodology
- Reference timeframe dependencies

## 📚 **Getting Started**

1. **Review Foundations** → Start with `1_FOUNDATIONS/`
2. **Pick a Concept** → Choose from `2_CORE_CONCEPTS/`
3. **Follow the Template** → Each folder has a standard structure
4. **Focus on Precision** → Ask: "Could a programmer implement this?"

---

## 🚧 **Project Status**

**Phase 1: Core Documentation** - Ongoing  
**Phase 2: Pseudocode Specifications** - Upcoming  
**Phase 3: Reference Implementation** - Future  
**Phase 4: Backtesting Framework** - Future  

---

## 💡 **Why This Approach?**

Traditional trading concepts often suffer from:
- Subjective interpretations
- Unclear entry/exit criteria
- Undefined risk parameters
- Poor backtestability

We're fixing this by building the **specification first**, ensuring every concept is:
- **Algorithmically testable**
- **Statistically verifiable**
- **Consistently reproducible**

---

## 📬 **Connect & Collaborate**

This is a **living documentation** project. Have insights on ICT concepts? Found edge cases? Want to contribute to a specific module?

**Open an issue** to:
- Discuss concept definitions
- Propose detection logic improvements
- Share example charts for edge cases
- Suggest integration approaches

---

## ⚠️ **Important Notes**

- This is **not financial advice**
- These concepts are for **educational and research purposes**
- Algorithmic trading involves **significant risk**
- Always test thoroughly in simulated environments first
